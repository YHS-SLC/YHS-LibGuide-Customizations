# YHS-LibGuide-Customizations
 This a customization project for York House School's Senior Learning Commons LibGuides 2 website.

- `/overrides` contains the actual code affecting the website.
- `/SLC - Archive for Live Server` is an archive of the website from Jan 14, 2025. It is used to provide a *somewhat functional* live server for development. Note that the archive cannot record dynamic content, such as our "All Databases" page.
- `YHS_database_list` .csv & .numbers files are for updating our list of databases

# To Do...
- Fix the broken dropdown menus on individual guides
- Styling Ideas
	- Would be nice to move the guide subject list to top of page, for visibility
	- afix nav to top of screen
	- make nav highlight current page https://stackoverflow.com/questions/34491182/make-bootstrap-tab-active-on-the-bases-of-url-link
	- Apply brand colours to site
	- Could use JS script to check subject in subject list, and add specific content to the list page?
	- Homepage
		- big rotating hero for any upcoming events
		- Breaking new arrivals into format & fiction/non-fiction
	- place additional search bar into footer
	- Use Tailwind (David is more familiar with it)
		- Use Pines UI: A tailwind ui library that also integrates Alpine JS for more functionality.
		- Need to watch for incompatability between Tailwind, Alpine JS, and existing LibGuides bootstrap. See breaking issues in https://yorkhouse.libguides.com/dev (which is the only page that uses guide-alt.html) 
		- Can't really use tailwind for LibGuide `{{Template_Value}}` content. need to be able to assign styles through parent container. Can use tailwind for new stand-alone components: Nav, Footer, Sidebar elements
- Content Ideas (Kaleb)
	- Write a friendly intro in the custom template for 
		- A-Z databases
		- Subject & Subject Landing pages
	- Courses? https://library.rrc.ca/LEARN_modules
	- Assign subjects to databases

	- add to databases

# LibGuide Limitations
- We are developing overrides for existing LibGuides conventions, and do not have the entire codebase to host in a live server. To combat this, an archive of the website was made using HTTrack. 
- Don't have a way to upload custom fonts - need to use [google hosted fonts](https://fonts.google.com/).
- Can upload custom images
- Can edit individual HTML templates for:
    - Homepage
    - Guides
    - Search Results
    - Subject Page
    - Profile
    - A-Z Guide Browser
- Can edit CSS & JS: Site-wide, or embed in per-page `<style>` & `<script>` tags
    - LibGuides will come with a number of default css configurations we can't easily remove without breaking searching/subject view things.

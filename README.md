# LibGuide Limitations
- Don't have a way to upload custom fonts - need to use [google hosted fonts](https://fonts.google.com/).
- Can upload custom images
- Can edit individual HTML templates for:
    - Homepage
    - Guides
    - Search Results
    - Subject Page
    - Profile
    - A-Z Guide Browser
- Can edit CSS & JS: Site-wide, or embed in per-page `<style>` & `<script>` tags
    - LibGuides will come with a number of default css configurations we can't easily remove without breaking searching/subject view things.
